#### Joining the Network

**[The IDL Network](https://idlnetwork.org/)** website provides articles, posts and pages of (hopefully) useful and interesting material on interdisciplinary learning. It also provides web-links and pointers to _free downloadable teaching resources_ that offer good exemplars of IDL and 'starter' ideas for and about IDL development and delivery. Think of it as a _newspaper or magazine all about IDL_, with links to _free resources_.

#### Subscribing to the website

Pop your email address in the form below and click "sign up" to receive notification of new articles when they are posted.

\[jetpack\_subscription\_form subscribe\_placeholder="Enter your email address" show\_subscribers\_total="false" button\_on\_newline="false" submit\_button\_text="Sign Up" custom\_font\_size="16px" custom\_border\_radius="0" custom\_border\_weight="1" custom\_padding="15" custom\_spacing="10" submit\_button\_classes="" email\_field\_classes="" show\_only\_email\_and\_button="true"\]

Alternatively, when you comment on a post, you are given the opportunity to receive new comments on that thread, or to be notified when new posts are made.

Don't worry, it's easy to unsubscribe at any time. We will not use your data for anything not connected to running this site.

#### House rules

Of course, this is a professional space and therefore we expect nothing but professional language and behaviour towards our visitors and users, including the authors of posts, and commenters. Posts and commentary are also expected to be relevant to interdisciplinary learning in Scotland. Thank you for your understanding.

#### Adding material

If you would like to contribute to the website, or a link to _IDL resources_, please [**get in touch**](https://idlnetwork.org/contact/). We are keen to hear from you, whether you have an idea for a single article, just want to learn, or would like to be a regular contributor.
