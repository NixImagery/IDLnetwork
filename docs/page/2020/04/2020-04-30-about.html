<p>Welcome to the Interdisciplinary Learning (IDL) Network.</p>

<p><strong>The IDL Network provides **an integrated website** for professional dialogue and learning where teachers and educators are able to:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>discuss, debate, question and learn about IDL within and across the Curriculum for Excellence</em></li>
  <li><em>promote and gain an understanding of IDL through the <strong>exemplification</strong>, sharing and curating of practical, high-quality <strong>interdisciplinary resources,</strong> <strong>ideas and approaches</strong></em></li>
  <li><em>contribute <strong>narratives</strong> about experiences of developing and delivering IDL</em></li>
  <li><em>receive and provide topical <strong>news, information and literature</strong> about recent developments in IDL</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Network, which is open to all, aims to support <strong>collaboration</strong> amongst educators of children and young people from 3 to 18 and beyond, including tertiary education. It will be particularly relevant for teachers, teacher educators, trainee teachers and probationers, school leaders, educators in further and higher education, and policymakers.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-the-network-do-in-practice"><strong>What will the Network do in practice?</strong></h3>

<p>The Network will provide a platform for addressing everyday questions and lively discussions amongst forum members, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do I….?</li>
  <li>Is this interdisciplinary or…..?</li>
  <li>Why does it matter?</li>
  <li>What is the best way to…….?</li>
  <li>What works or doesn’t work?</li>
  <li>Where will I find some resources/ideas on…….?</li>
  <li>Here is a…(learning idea, resource, question, problem, challenge, comment, opinion etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-have-we-developed-an-idl-network">Why have we developed an IDL Network?</h3>

<p>The Network is one of several outcomes of <em>the Royal Society of Edinburgh’s (RSE) 2019 conference</em> on “<em><a href="https://www.rse.org.uk/event/interdisciplinary-learning-creative-thinking-for-a-complex-world/">Interdisciplinary Learning: Creative Thinking for a Complex World</a>”</em>. At the conference, a questionnaire was circulated to around 160 delegates, respondents to which (practitioners, school leaders and teacher educators) supported the establishment of a teacher forum, which the RSE has co-ordinated.</p>

<p>An overarching challenge to the implementation of IDL is the lack of a common understanding and clarity about what constitutes IDL. Improving our understanding of IDL and related approaches to connecting subject learning across the education community is therefore a priority.</p>

<h3 id="network-development-and-management"><strong>Network Development and Management</strong></h3>

<p>In order to grow and thrive, the Network needs to attract the active support and contributions of a ‘critical mass’ of teachers, teacher educators, educators in further and higher education, school leaders, policymakers and other interested contributors. It aims to build a collaborative, participatory, open and forward-looking community of practice that includes members willing to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share ideas and resources</li>
  <li>ask and respond to questions</li>
  <li>contribute to discussions</li>
  <li>contribute to developing and managing the Network.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Network has been established as an integrated <strong>website</strong> with the aim of forming and building a broad, outward-looking community of practice around IDL.</p>
