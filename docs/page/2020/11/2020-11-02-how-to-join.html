<p><strong><a href="https://idlnetwork.org/">The IDL Network</a></strong> website provides articles, posts and pages of (hopefully) useful and interesting material on interdisciplinary learning. It also provides web-links and pointers to <em>free downloadable teaching resources</em> that offer good exemplars of IDL and ‘starter’ ideas for and about IDL development and delivery. Think of it as a <em>newspaper or magazine all about IDL</em>, with links to <em>free resources</em>.</p>
