<p>The website <a href="http://idlnetwork.org/">IDLNetwork.org</a> is operated on behalf of a growing community of people who are interested in interdisciplinary learning. It was established following consultation informally facilitated by the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) following their 2019 IDL conference. The initial steering group is Professor Colin Graham of the University of Edinburgh and the RSE, William Hardie of the RSE, and Nick Hood of the University of Edinburgh. Neither the University of Edinburgh nor the Royal Society of Edinburgh have any formal connection or affiliation with the IDL Network.</p>
